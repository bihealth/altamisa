# History

## v0.2.0

- Switching to `attrs` instead of using `Namedtuple`.
  This gets rid of some warts regarding constructor overriding but should offer the same functionality otherwise.
- Various updates to the documentation.

## v0.1.0

First public release.

- Started out with ISA-TAB parser and `NamedTuple`-based data model.
